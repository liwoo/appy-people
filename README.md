# Description
A Simple iOS (iPhone Only) App that displays my most recent Instagram Posts

# Functionality
Consumes Instagram API (with permissions to access a validated token) and displays the latest 20 posts in a UITableView.  I made use of custom cell to display the list.  Tapping a particular cell displays the details of the post - including the full caption, as well as user specific information.

Please let me know if there is any problem fetching from Instagram, as the tokens are known to change ever so randomly.  Enjoy!
